Learn how to use Mina’s implementation of the Rosetta API.
</Subhead>

[Rosetta API](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/welcome) is an open-source specification and set of tools that make deploying and interacting with the blockchain quick and easy.

Use Rosetta API if you are:
- Querying historical data from the Mina blockchain
- Integrating the Mina blockchain with your exchange
- Building blockchain applications, such as explorers and wallets

Using Rosetta for building your application is preferrable, as it's API is more appropriate for applications and far more stable than GraphQL.
