:::info

The code samples in this section are tested with Python 3.9

:::

## Prerequisites

The following series of guides demonstrate how to perform common Rosetta API use-cases. 

All code samples are written in Python and require the `requests` library to be installed on your Python environment.

This can be done with a following command:

    pip3 install requests


The source code for all code samples is available on the official [Mina Documentation Github page](https://github.com/o1-labs/docs2/tree/main/examples/exchange-operators/rosetta_samples.py) and should be used only for demonstration purposes.

## Set up sample project

Start with the required imports and define constants:

```python
import json
from subprocess import run, PIPE
from time import sleep

from requests import post

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3087"
SIGNER_PATH = 'path/to/signer.exe'
MAINNET_NETWORK_IDENTIFIER = {
    "network_identifier": {
        "blockchain": "mina",
        "network": "mainnet"
    }
}
MINA_TOKEN_ID = "1"
MINA_DECIMALS = 9
MINA_SYMBOL = "MINA"
MINA_CURVE_TYPE = "pallas"
MINA_SIGNATURE_TYPE = "schnorr_poseidon"
```
